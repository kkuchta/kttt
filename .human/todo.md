# TODOs

An AI should never touch this file

[x] Register kttt.io on route53
[x] Move off of Railway - it doesn't support apex domains through route53. Maybe fly.io?
[]- Finish blog post
[]- Update about page

- Update all copy
  X Increase contrast on board
- X Make move switch a bit more obvious - maybe plus when its your turn
- X Remove "Winning line: (1,3) → (2,2) → (3,1)" thing
