# Kriegspiel Tic Tac Toe

A vibe-coded, socket-based, multiplayer version of Tic Tac Toe where you can't see your opponents's moves. Inspired by [this tweet](https://x.com/ZachWeiner/status/1755205085947109517) and built as an excuse to practice AI-driven development. I have neither written _nor_ read any code in this repo. The only hand-written thing in here is the copy within the app and these first two paragraphs.

The remainder of this readme is whatever the AI decides it wants. Apologies in advance for the emoji overload.

---

A web-based multiplayer implementation of Kriegspiel Tic Tac Toe - a hidden information variant of classic tic-tac-toe where players cannot see their opponent's moves until they accidentally try to place a piece on an occupied space.

## 🎮 Game Rules

- **Hidden Information**: Players can only see their own pieces on the board
- **Move Resolution**: Attempting to place on an opponent's piece reveals it and costs your turn
- **Victory**: First to get three in a row wins
- **Multiplayer**: Share a game URL to play with friends

For detailed game rules, see [Game Rules](/.ai/game_rules.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.18.0 or higher - matches production)
- npm
- Docker (for Redis)
- make (optional, but recommended)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd kttt

# Install dependencies
make install
# or: npm install

# Start Redis (required for data persistence)
make redis-up

# Start development servers
make dev
# or: npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

- **Development**: http://localhost:3000 (Vite dev server with proxy)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001 (Express server - proxied through frontend)

**Note**: Access everything through the frontend URL (localhost:3000). The backend runs on 3001 but is proxied automatically.

### Redis Development Setup

The application uses Redis for persistent game storage. We provide Docker Compose for easy local development:

```bash
# Start Redis container
make redis-up

# View Redis logs
make redis-logs

# Connect to Redis CLI
make redis-cli

# Stop Redis
make redis-down

# Reset Redis data (clean slate)
make redis-reset
```

#### Storage Configuration

You can configure Redis connection via environment variables:

```bash
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_TTL_SECONDS=14400  # 4 hours
REDIS_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=5000  # 5 seconds
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Commands

We provide both Makefile targets and npm scripts for all development tasks:

#### Core Development

```bash
make dev          # Start both client and server in development mode
make dev-client   # Start only the client (Vite dev server)
make dev-server   # Start only the server (tsx watch mode)
make build        # Build for production
make start        # Start production server
```

#### Redis Management

```bash
make redis-up     # Start Redis container
make redis-down   # Stop Redis container
make redis-logs   # View Redis logs
make redis-cli    # Connect to Redis CLI
make redis-reset  # Reset Redis data (fresh start)
```

#### Code Quality

```bash
make lint         # Check code with ESLint
make lint-fix     # Auto-fix ESLint issues
make format       # Format code with Prettier
make format-check # Check formatting without changes
make check        # Run both linting and format checks
```

#### Workflow Shortcuts

```bash
make setup        # Initial project setup
make pre-commit   # Format, fix, and check before committing
make ci           # Full CI pipeline (install, check, build)
make clean        # Clean all build artifacts and dependencies
make clean-dist   # Clean only build artifacts
```

#### Testing

```bash
make test         # Run all tests (requires Redis)
make test-watch   # Run tests in watch mode
make test-coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

**Redis Testing:**

- By default, tests **require Redis** to be running and will **fail** if unavailable
- To skip Redis tests: `SKIP_REDIS_TESTS=true make test`
- To run only non-Redis tests: `npm test -- --testPathIgnorePatterns=RedisStorage`

#### Help

```bash
make help         # Show all available targets
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io + TypeScript
- **Build Tools**: Vite (client), tsx (server)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript

### Development Philosophy

- **Single Package**: Simplified dependency management
- **Shared Types**: End-to-end type safety
- **Real-time**: WebSocket-based multiplayer
- **Server Authoritative**: All game logic on server

## 🌐 Deployment

### Production

**Live Application**: https://kttt.io

The application is deployed on Fly.io with Redis storage via Upstash.

### Local Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
make build

# Start production server
make start
```

The built application will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to Fly.io
fly deploy

# View production logs
fly logs

# Open live application
fly open
```

## 🧪 Code Quality

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting:

- **ESLint**: TypeScript and React linting rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Pre-commit checks**: Automated formatting and linting

### Pre-commit Workflow

```bash
# Before committing, run:
make pre-commit

# This will:
# 1. Auto-fix any fixable ESLint issues
# 2. Format code with Prettier
# 3. Check for remaining issues
```

## 📁 Configuration Files

- **TypeScript**: `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.server.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`
- **ESLint**: `.eslintrc.cjs`
- **Prettier**: `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`
- **Vite**: `vite.config.ts`
- **Git**: `.gitignore`
