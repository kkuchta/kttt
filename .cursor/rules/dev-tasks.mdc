## Development Commands

This project uses a Makefile to standardize development tasks. Always check the Makefile first for available commands before suggesting npm scripts directly.

### Key Make Targets:
- `make help` - Shows all available targets with descriptions
- `make dev` - Start both client and server in development mode.  You should never run this - the user will already have them running in a separate terminal.  Nor should you run the dev:server or dev:client commands directly.
- `make lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `make lint-fix` - Auto-fix ESLint issues
- `make format` - Format code with Prettier
- `make check` - Run both linting and format checks
- `make pre-commit` - Complete pre-commit workflow (lint-fix + format + check)
- `make build` - Build for production
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts and dependencies
- `make setup` - Initial project setup

### Development Workflow:
1. Use `make dev` to start development servers
2. Use `make pre-commit` before committing changes
3. Use `make help` to see all available commands
4. Prefer Make targets over direct npm scripts when available

When suggesting development commands, always mention the Make target first, then optionally include the npm equivalent.
