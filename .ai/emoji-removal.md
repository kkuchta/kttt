# Emoji Removal Analysis

This document catalogs all emoji usage in the user-facing parts of the application to consider removal and replacement strategies.

# Instructions

For each emoji, one at a time (no batching):

1. Identify where it is
2. Consider its context and what its purpose is
3. Identify what, if anything, we should replace it with. Consider the initial suggestions below, but think creatively here.
4. Execute the change for one emoji only.
5. Update the status for that emoji in the table below.
