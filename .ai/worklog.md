# Worklog

This is a log of ongoing work. It contains the tasks we've done and the tasks we've yet to do. Whenever we think of something new we'll need to do, we'll add it here. Whenever starting on a task, break it down into sub-tasks (if it's not already tiny) and put those in here.

Do _not_ do multiple tasks at once. Pause for instruction after each task.
